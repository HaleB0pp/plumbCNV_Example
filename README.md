# plumbCNV_Example
This is an example dataset to test plumbCNV.
Run the file 'run_example.R', if everything is installed and up to date it should run through successfully. Feel free to send me bug reports if somethings fails if you have the latest version of R, bioconductor and you have installed the latest versions of my packages: NCmisc, reader, bigpca, and humarray [tar.gz files for development versions of each package can be found in this repository].
